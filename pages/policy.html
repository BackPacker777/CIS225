			<h3>Course Policies:</h3>
			<h4>Attendance</h4>
				<p>It is your responsibility to attend all class sessions. If you can't make it, you need to notify me via email. I do not need a reason, just notification. If you fail to notify me more than once, I will lower your grade 20%. If you fail to notify me after that, I will ask you to drop the class for no credit.</p>
			<h4>Lateness</h4>
				<p>As long as you are not disruptive, I do not care how late you are.</p>
			<h4>NCMC Snow Cancellation Policy</h4>
				<p>If the public schools cancel class in Cheboygan or Gaylord, NCMC classes will also be cancelled. If Petoskey schools are cancelled, NCMC may be open or may just delay opening until later that day. It is best to sign up for My Alerts, found on the portal.</p>
			<h4>Class Participation</h4>
				<p>Engage in our discussions as you see fit.</p>
			<h4>Academic Dishonesty</h4>
				<p>Academic Dishonesty, misconduct, cheating or plagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty including acquisition without permission of tests or other academic materials. Included are those students who aid and abet, as well as those who attempt such behavior. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to, the use
				whether by paraphrase or direct quotation, of published or unpublished work of another person without full and clear attribution. It also includes the unacknowledged use of materials prepared by another person or agency engaged in the selling of term papers or other academic materials. Incidents of academic dishonesty
				shall be dealt with according to the procedures outlined in Academic Dishonesty as found in the student handbook. Any act of academic dishonesty in this course will result in a zero (0) for the assignment and possible failure of the course.</p>
			<h4>Late Assignments</h4>
				<p>All assignments must be turned in on the due date. If you can't accomplish this, I must be notified by email. I will then decide if I will accept the late assignment for full credit. The late penalty is as follows: First assignment one week late = 25% markdown. Any more than this will not be accepted for credit.</p>
			<h4>Test Make up</h4>
				<p>You may make up a missed test the following week or by appointment for full credit.</p>
			<h4>Electronic Device usage in class</h4>
				<p>As long as you are not disruptive, I don't care what you choose to use. (phone, .mp3 player, laptop, etc.)</p>
